# Hello World!


I have great passion for computer science and computing in general. My dream is to continue on this path to learn advanced topics such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Ultimately, I want to apply my knowledge to solve worldly problems for the greater good.

I have so far been programming in languages such as Java, JavaScript, C, Python, R, and HTML.

I am practicing the professional practice of making new branches and not making changes directly on the master branch. I have installed git to do this and use SourceTree to manage my changes.
