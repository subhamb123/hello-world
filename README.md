# Hello World!

This is my first repository! 

I'm Subham. I want to study computer science and my dream is to continue on this path to learn advanced topics such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Ultimately, I want to use my knowledge of this and apply it in the world such as making technology to make life simpler for unfortunate people. 

I have been programming for many years in languages such as Java, Javascript, C, Python, R, and HTML.
