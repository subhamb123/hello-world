# Hello World!


I have great passion for computer science and computing in general. My dream is to continue on this path to learn advanced topics such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Ultimately, I want to apply my knowledge to solve worldly problems for the greater good.

I have so far been programming in languages such as Java, JavaScript, C, C++, Python, R, and HTML.

I am still learning how to use git more efficiently. I have recently started using SourceTree to manage the local branches more effectively and installed git.
